# Privacy Policy — Universal Load Controller

_Last updated: 23 November 2025_

## Overview
Universal Load Controller (“the App”) controls electronic loads (e.g., Atorch DL24P) via Bluetooth or serial/TCP bridges. The App is operated by the developer (“we”) and runs entirely on your device.

## Data We Access
- **Bluetooth**: Needed to scan for and connect to your load device.
- **Location permission** (Android <12): Required by the OS for Bluetooth scanning. We do not track or store location.
- **Network**: Only used if you explicitly connect to a TCP/HTTP endpoint you provide (e.g., serial-over-TCP). No background calls are made.
- **Storage**: Used to save/export test data you generate (CSV/PDF) on your device.

## Advertising (Free Version Only)
The free version of this app displays advertisements through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and process data according to Google's Privacy Policy:
- Device information (device model, OS version)
- Ad interaction data
- Advertising ID for personalized ads

You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings. The Premium version contains no advertisements or ad-related data collection.

## Data We Do Not Collect
- No personal data, identifiers, analytics, or usage telemetry are collected by us directly.
- All test data and settings remain on your device unless you export/share them.

## How Data Is Used
- To communicate with your load device (Bluetooth or TCP).
- To display live measurements and logs.
- To save or export files only when you request it (CSV/PDF/share intents).

## Your Choices
- You can revoke Bluetooth/Location permissions at any time in system settings.
- You can delete app data from system settings to remove saved preferences/logs.
- You control whether to export/share files; nothing is sent automatically.
